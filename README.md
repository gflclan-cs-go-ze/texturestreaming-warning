# texturestreaming-warning

**This plugin should no longer be necessary following the [2020/06/03 CS:GO update](https://blog.counter-strike.net/index.php/2020/06/30359/)**

Warns players who have the "Texture Streaming" video setting enabled in CS:GO to turn it off. This was created because enabling this setting can currently cause visual bugs and crashes on custom maps.
